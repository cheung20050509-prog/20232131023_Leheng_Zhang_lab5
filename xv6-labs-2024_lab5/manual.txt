# User Manual for XV6 Networking

## Overview
This version of XV6 includes a driver for the Intel E1000 network card and a basic UDP network stack.

## Networking Features
- **E1000 Driver**: Handles packet transmission and reception.
- **UDP Sockets**: Support for `bind`, `send`, `recv` system calls.
- **ARP/IP**: Basic handling of ARP requests and IP packets.

## Usage
User programs can include `kernel/net.h` and use the following system calls:
- `bind(port)`: Bind to a local UDP port.
- `send(sport, dst_ip, dst_port, buf, len)`: Send a UDP packet.
- `recv(dport, &src_ip, &src_port, buf, maxlen)`: Receive a UDP packet.

## Testing
Run `nettest` in the shell to verify functionality.
